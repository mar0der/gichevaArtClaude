## Project Overview
- Build a modern, responsive website for abstract artist Radka Gicheva under the GichevaArt brand at www.gichevaart.com.
- Focus on showcasing her artwork portfolio with a clean, gallery-style experience that can grow into future platforms, including an iOS app.

## Core Scope
- Provide a welcoming home page, a comprehensive gallery, an artist biography section, and a contact page for inquiries.
- Surface exhibition highlights and selected social media activity to reinforce credibility and audience engagement.
- Keep all artwork data and content in a dedicated backend so the frontend consumes it through a REST API, enabling easy reuse across web and mobile.
- Offer email-based inquiries for purchasing artworks today, with room to expand into direct online sales later.
